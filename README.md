## Summary
This backend API is constructed using Ruby on rails. The API connects to our React Native front end through our RESTful routes. This application connects to the Google Vision API and uses a base64 string to transfer the captured image from frontend to backend then off to the Google's API for analysis. This application utilizes a PostgrSQL database and ActiveRecord ROM to interpret information from the database.
